A Litecoin full node for building applications and services with Node.js. A node is extensible and can be configured to run additional services. At the minimum a node has an interface to [Litecoin Core with additional indexing](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecore-litecoin) for more advanced address queries. Additional services can be enabled to make a node more useful such as exposing new APIs, running a block explorer and wallet service.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g litecore-node
litecore-node start
```

Note: For your convenience, we distribute bitcoind binaries for x86_64 Linux and x86_64 Mac OS X. Upon npm install, the binaries for your platform will be downloaded. For more detailed installation instructions, or if you want to compile the project yourself, then please see the Bitcore branch of [Litecoin Core with additional indexing](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecore-litecoin).

## Prerequisites

- GNU/Linux x86_32/x86_64, or OSX 64bit *(for bitcoind distributed binaries)*
- Node.js v0.10, v0.12 or v4
- ZeroMQ *(libzmq3-dev for Ubuntu/Debian or zeromq on OSX)*
- ~200GB of disk storage
- ~8GB of RAM

## Configuration

Litecore includes a Command Line Interface (CLI) for managing, configuring and interfacing with your Litecore Node.

```bash
litecore-node create -d <bitcoin-data-dir> mynode
cd mynode
litecore-node install <service>
litecore-node install https://github.com/yourname/helloworld
```

This will create a directory with configuration files for your node and install the necessary dependencies. For more information about (and developing) services, please see the [Service Documentation](docs/services.md).
